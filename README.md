# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## 1. Problem Definition

In a statement,
> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## 3. Evaluation

> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

## 4. Features

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features of the data.
## 5. Conclusion
We've created a model to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not according to several medical mesurements, and we achieved more than 80% accuracy, it still needs to be enhanced.
